# qXmoji â€“ X11 emoji keyboard

qXmoji is a very simple emoji keyboard designed to work with any X11
application. It uses Qt to show its GUI, but "types" emojis using plain X11
keyboard events.

The GUI itself displays the emojis as "text", and prefers the `Noto Color
Emoji` font for that, falling back to `Noto Emoji` and then to whatever is
configured as the default font. So, for best visual results, install `Noto
Color Emoji`.

## How it works

X11 has no concept of "Unicode keyboard events" like e.g. Windows has.
Keyboard events in X11 always use a "key code" in the range 8-255 which are
meant to identify an actual key on the keyboard. Therefore the only way to
inject Unicode characters as keyboard events is to temporarily modify the
keyboard mapping.

When qXmoji "types" an emoji, it first determines the number of Unicode
codepoints needed, remaps the first `n` keycodes to these codepoints and then
sends key-press and key-release events for these in sequence, using the
`Xtest` extension. Without the extension, only "synthetic" events can be sent,
and many X11 clients would just ignore them.

When the sequence is complete, it sleeps for a short time before restoring
the original keyboard mapping. Waiting is necessary because otherwise, the X11
client receiving the keyboard events could update its own mapping before it is
used to map the keyboard events still queued.

## Limitations

* The default time (50 ms) waiting before restoring the original keyboard
  mapping is a wild guess that seems to work while testing. It could also be
  too short (e.g.  with a slower connection to the X server), so it's
  configurable in the range 0 - 500 ms.  There's unfortunately no way to know
  when a client processed all its keyboard events, so waiting is the only
  option.

* Modifier keys (like shift, alt, meta, ...) could interfer with the faked key
  press and release events. It might be possible to add code temporarily
  disabling other keyboards and setting modifiers to a known state, but this
  would add a lot of complexity. The simpler workaround is not to touch any
  other keyboards while clicking on an emoji in qXmoji.

* Many emojis consist of a sequence of Unicode codepoints. Whether they are
  displayed correctly as a single emoji depends on the X11 client receiving
  the fake keyboard events. While testing, `xterm` couldn't display any
  multi-codepoint emoji, while `chromium` got it right for most of them, but
  with a few exceptions.

## Building

To obtain the source from git, make sure to include submodules, e.g. with the
`--recurse-submodules` option to `git clone`. Release tarballs will include
everything needed for building.

Dependencies:

* Qt libs: `Core`, `Gui` and `Widgets`, plus `X11Extras` for Qt5
* xcb libs: `libxcb-xtest`
* Qt's `moc` and `rcc` utilities
* GNU make

To build qXmoji with Qt6, just type

    make

To build with Qt5, type

    make QT_VERSION=5

Typical make variables like `prefix` (defaults to `/usr/local`) and `DESTDIR`
(defaults to empty) are supported, as well as variables to override individual
tools like `CC`, `CXX`, `MOC`, etc.

There's also

    make install

to install qXmoji to the selected prefix and DESTDIR.

If your default `make` tool is not GNU make, the latter is probably installed
using the name `gmake` (e.g. on BSD systems), so type that instead of `make`.
